# Portal PWA
The Portal supports being used as a Progressive Web Application on mobile platforms. It may work on desktop platforms which support it, but most support is based around mobile platforms.

## Features of the PWA
As a PWA, the Portal is allowed to run in the background and offline. It appears in the app switcher as its own app and not as a tab in Safari.
