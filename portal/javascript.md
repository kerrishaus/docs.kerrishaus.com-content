# JavaScript on the Portal

Unfortunately, there are some places where JavaScript is absolutely required in order for certain features to be possible. In cases like this, running a page without JavaScript could result in the page being unusable in regards to its intended purpose.

We know that JavaScript is sometimes overused on the internet, and many people prefer to browse with JavaScript blocked by browser extensions, or disabled entirely. We put great effort into attempting to replicate most functionality provided by JavaScript with server side technologies, however unfortunately there are cases where it simply isn't possible, such as live editing or custom page elements.

If you happen to land on a page which for some reason requires the use of JavaScript, you will see a message at the top of the page letting you know. If the page is meant to be usable without JavaScript, the message will be yellow. If the page is completely unusable for its inteded purpose, the message will be red. Pages with red messages **will not** be usable without JavaScript.
