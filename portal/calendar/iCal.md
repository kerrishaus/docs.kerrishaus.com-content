# The Portal supports the iCal standard
The iCal standard helps organise calendar data in a way that is useable by many different sytems, which may not be related to one another. The Portal calendar system supports this standard, allowing you to see your Portal events in other applications. As of writing, the Portal only supports *exporting* calendars. It cannot import and display Calendar data from other systems.

# Exporting the Calendar
1. From the main Calendar page, select one of your Calendars and open its settings page.
2. From the calendar's settings page, click `Sharing Settings`.
3. Copy the shareable iCal link.

For instructions on how to import a Portal calendar into another application, refer that specific application's instructions.
