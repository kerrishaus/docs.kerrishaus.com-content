# RSS
The Portal has a homepage module which supports RSS 2.0 and Atom feeds. 

Feeds can be added by clicking the manage button in the bottom left corner of the Widget.

If a feed does not provide an author, the hostname from which the feed was retrieved is shown instead.

The RSS feed will show Portal announcements.
