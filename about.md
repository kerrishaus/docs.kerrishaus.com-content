# About this Wiki.

Like Facepunch before us, this is our attempt at a wiki system that serves exactly the purposes we need it for.  

This wiki was built from the ground up (aside from [[parsedown]]), and is [open source on GitHub](https://git.kerrishaus.com/docs.kerrishaus.com).

# How to edit

You can make contributions to this wiki by forking and submitting pull requests from [the content repository on GitHub.](https://git.kerrishaus.com/docs.kerrishaus.com)

This wiki uses Markdown for formatting, and specifically targets *[GFM]: Github Flavoured Markdown. However, it is extended by Markdown-Extra, and other plugins. You can view the full formatting guide for this wiki [here](https://docs.kerrishaus.com/formatting).
