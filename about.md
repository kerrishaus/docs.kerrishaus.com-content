# About this Wiki.

Like Facepunch before us, this is our attempt at a wiki system that serves exactly the purposes we need it for.  

This wiki was built from the ground up (aside from [[parsedown]]), and is [open source on GitHub](https://git.kerrishaus.com/docs.kerrishaus.com).

# How to edit

You can make contributions to this wiki by forking and submitting pull requests from [the content repository on GitHub.](https://git.kerrishaus.com/docs.kerrishaus.com)
