# Origin vs Destination Sales Tax

**Origin State**: Pays tax based on where the order was placed. Sales tax should be charged based on the address of the business.
**Destination State**: Pays tax based on where the buyer takes possession of the product. This means sales tax should generally be charged based on the shipping address. This location is also considered the point of sale.
