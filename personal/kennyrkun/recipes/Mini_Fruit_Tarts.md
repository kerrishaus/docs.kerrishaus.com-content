This is an abridged recipe from https://www.thebakerchick.com/mini-sugar-cookie-fruit-tarts/#mv-creation-42-jtr

# For the Crust
1. Grease a mini-muffin tin, set aside. 
2. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. In a large bowl cream together 1/2 cup butter, softened (4 oz or 1 stick) and 3/4 cups white sugar.
4. Add 1 egg yolk, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix until smooth and fluffy.
5. Add 1 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda & 1/4 teaspoon baking powder to a small bowl, stir together and then add to the sugar-butter mixture.
6. Mix until well combined (dough may seem crumbly.)
7. Use a small cookie scoop to portion 1 1/2 inch balls of dough, and use your hands to roll them into a smooth ball. (I found the dough seemed dry until I rolled each scoop by hand.)
8. Portion a dough ball into each of the wells of your pan, and press down slightly.
9. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges are golden. Allow to cool before removing from the pan.

# For the Filling
1. Cream together 1- 8oz block of cream cheese, softened and 2 cups powdered sugar until thick and smooth. 
2. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.
3. Pipe or spread the filling into the cooled cookie shells. 
4. Top with fresh fruit.
5. Store in the fridge until ready to serve.
