# General
Like the Anytone 878, certian key functions cannot be be bound to a long press and must be bound to a short press even though tough the function itself will activate with a long press. Additionally, when bound to a short press, they disable the ability to assign a different function to the long press. These features are:
- Emergency Alarm

# Remote Head Mounting
The 578 does not support remote head mounting. There is at least one community made product which attempts to do this, although it has some trouble. https://blaydefab.com/index.php/product/anytone-578-faceplate-relocation-kit/

# Handheld Speaker Mic
- The up and down buttons on the handheld speaker mic change the channel in the current zone up or down. The up and down buttons do not function if the microphone is unlocked. The functions of the up and down buttons cannot be reprogrammed.
- The little A/B rubber bits on the top of the speaker mic indicate the side you are transmitting on. The A/B rubber bits on the left middle next to the PTT button indicate which is currently selected.
- The speaker in the speaker mic is very quiet.

# Airband Receive
- You cannot receive more than one AM channel at one time.
- AM Squelch can be set in Radio Set > AM Squelch (should update this to make sure and add CPS location)
